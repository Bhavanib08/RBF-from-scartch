# RBF Neural Network
### *-* Created an RBF Network based on Gaussian kernel functions with spread function 
### *-* Compared the performance results( mean square error) by varying the spread parameter while keeping it the same for all kernel functions. The findings are recored
### *-* The centers were chose in two different for the sake of analysis:
#### Randomly selected the centers from the input data
#### Used K-means algorithm to find the centers.
